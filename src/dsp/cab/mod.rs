// The blended convolution above is the cab's *linear* response (cone+cab+mic+room
// magnitude and the reflection/modal time structure). Two things a fixed IR can
// never capture happen at the speaker itself, *before* the mic picks the sound up,
// so they are modelled on the mono drive signal feeding the convolver:
//
//   • cone-breakup saturation — a real cone is not a perfectly rigid piston; pushed
//     hard it flexes and the radiated waveform soft-saturates, adding low-order
//     harmonic "thickness" that grows with how hard the cone is driven;
//   • power compression — the voice coil heats under sustained high power, its
//     resistance rises, and acoustic output compresses. It is a *thermal* effect:
//     slow to engage and slow to release, so transients punch through while
//     sustained loud passages "push back". This is what makes a loud cab feel alive
//     rather than a flat playback of an IR.
//
// Both are deliberately gentle. The goal is the weight of a real driver, not an
// audible distortion/limiter effect, so at normal levels the signal passes almost
// untouched and the shaping only emerges when the cab is genuinely driven hard.

/// Cone-breakup soft saturation. `1 + DRIVE` small-signal gain ≈ unity (a clean
/// cone), with a gentle, slightly asymmetric saturation on peaks. The asymmetry
/// adds the even-harmonic warmth a real cone produces; any DC it introduces is

// than the body — the same class of physics one octave up.
//
//   • grille reflection — the front grille (perforated metal + cloth/frame) sits a
//     couple of cm proud of the cone. Treble radiated forward reflects off it, back
//     to the cone, and re-radiates to the mic: a ~0.13 ms round-trip echo. Long
//     wavelengths simply diffract around the perforations — the grille is acoustically
//     transparent in the lows — so only the top is combed, the metallic sheen/"air" a
//     close capture picks up off the grille. This is the effect God's Cab's grill knob
//     leans on.
//   • dust-cap reflection — the rigid central dome sits proud of the surrounding cone
//     and beams the extreme top from ~1.5 cm nearer the capsule than the cone around
//     it: a ~45 µs path difference that ripples only the very top (>8 kHz), the fine

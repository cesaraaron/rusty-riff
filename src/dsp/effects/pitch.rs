/// Sits early in the mono chain (right after the gate, before the drives) so it
/// works like a real whammy pedal: the *shifted* note is what the amp's gain stage
/// then clips. That placement is the whole point — octave-down for a fake-baritone
/// heaviness, octave-up shrieks and dive-bombs, all feeding raw into the distortion.
///
/// Algorithm: the classic two-tap crossfaded varispeed delay line ("H910"-style
/// granular shifter). Input is written to a ring buffer; two read taps sweep through
/// it at a rate set by the pitch ratio, kept half a grain apart. A raised-cosine
/// window fades each tap to silence exactly at the point where it wraps past the
/// grain boundary, so the two taps crossfade seamlessly and the wrap discontinuity
/// is inaudible. It is not phase-vocoder clean — a little warble is inherent — but
/// that roughness is part of the whammy character, and it costs almost nothing.
///
/// Knob ranges (all normalised 0–1):
///   PITCH → transpose interval: 0 = −12 st (octave down), 0.5 = unison, 1 = +12 st.
///   MIX   → dry/wet blend; 0 = dry, 1 = fully wet (full dive-bomb).
///   TONE  → low-pass on the wet path, taming the granular fizz; 0 = dark, 1 = open.

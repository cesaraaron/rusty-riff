/// pulse), while **vibrato** modulates *pitch* (a short LFO-swept delay line warps
/// the note up and down — the Boss VB-2 wobble). Sharing one LFO lets a single
/// pedal morph between them: MODE 0 = pure tremolo, MODE 1 = pure vibrato, and the
/// middle blends both for a seasick, combined movement.
///
/// Sits in the post-cab stereo rack after the other modulations (flanger, chorus,
/// phaser), just before the delay — the last bit of *movement* applied to the
/// finished tone, ahead of the time-based ambience. Both channels share the LFO,
/// so the pulse/wobble is coherent across the stereo image and the cab's existing
/// L/R decorrelation is preserved.

///   RATE  → LFO speed, 0.5–14 Hz (exponential).
///   DEPTH → modulation intensity (amplitude swing and/or pitch swing).
///   SHAPE → LFO waveform, sine → soft square (choppiness of the tremolo).
///   MODE  → amplitude (tremolo) ↔ pitch (vibrato) blend.

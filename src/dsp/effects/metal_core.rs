/// Boss ML-2 Metal Core simulation — an ultra-high-gain distortion voiced for
/// modern metal: far more gain than the DS-1, a scooped mid character, and a
/// powerful active two-band (Low/High) EQ instead of a single tone control.
///
/// Signal path:
///   DC block → input HP → fixed mid-scoop → [8× OS: pre-clip HP → pre-clip LP →
///   two cascaded soft-clip stages] → post-clip HP → active Low shelf →
///   active High shelf → post-clip LP → level
///
/// Character & authenticity:
///   • The ML-2 is a *tight, brutal* pedal designed to make any amp sound metal on
///     its own. Its gain comes from **two cascaded clipping stages**: the first
///     saturates, the second thickens it into the long, singing, compressed sustain
///     metal rhythm and lead lean on. But driven flat-out the cascade squares the
///     wave into a fizzy, all-odd buzz that turns chords to mud — *and* its enormous
///     small-signal gain amplifies the hiss and hum riding under the notes into a
///     wash of "noise". So both stages are kept sane (first stage ≤22×, was 101×;
///     second push 1.5×, was 3×): a normal note still slams both stages to the rail,
///     so loud saturation and output level are unchanged, but the quiet noise floor
///     — amplified only by the small-signal slope — drops ~9 dB, and decays clean up
///     dynamically instead of hanging as a buzzy, over-compressed tail.
///   • A **fixed mid-scoop** (~650 Hz) is baked into the voice — the ML-2's scooped,
///     aggressive tonality — but kept moderate so the tone stays articulate rather
///     than hollow. The player's own scoop lives in the active EQ on top.
///   • Tightened on both sides of the clipper like the DS-1: a pre-clip high-pass
///     trims low-mud before the massive gain, a **pre-clip low-pass** rounds the top
///     off the wave so a chord's upper harmonics don't intermodulate into fizz, and
///     a post-clip high-pass strips the woof the clipper generates, so the low end
///     stays defined for palm-mute chug.
///   • Genuine 2nd-harmonic warmth comes from **asymmetric rail levels** (the
///     negative half saturates toward −1.3 vs +1.0), which survive the cascade's
///     hard saturation — unlike a DC bias, which just washes out to a DC offset the
///     post-clip HP removes. A purely-symmetric clipper makes only the clinical odd
///     buzz; the tiny DC this asymmetry leaves is removed by the post-clip high-pass.
///   • The **active Low/High EQ** is a wide-range shelving pair (±15 dB): the ML-2's
///     EQ is powerful enough to reshape the whole voice, from a bass-heavy wall to a
///     bright, cutting lead. 8× oversampling keeps the aggressive clip harmonics from
///     aliasing into digital fizz.

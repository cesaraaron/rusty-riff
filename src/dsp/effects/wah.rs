/// becomes a dynamic, vocal auto-wah that tracks your picking.
///
/// A real wah is a treadle-swept bandpass, but a terminal has no expression pedal,
/// so the envelope follower stands in for the foot: the louder the input, the higher

/// ahead of it would flatten the very envelope it rides) and the vocal quack is what
/// the distortion then saturates, the classic wah-into-fuzz voice.
///

///   Q    → resonance/sharpness of the peak — the "quack".
///   MIX  → dry/wet blend; a real wah is fully wet, but a blend keeps body.
